# Birt-s-CSV2FXT-bitcoincharts-server-compatible
Modified CSV2FXT file for compatibility with tick data downloaded from bitcoincharts servers

Fixes deadlock problem with Birt's CSV2FXT file version 0.50 that occurs when trying to process a CSV file with tick data downloaded from bitcoincharts server. 

The original version of the script as well as the latest version Tick Data Suite can be downloaded from [Birt's website](http://1dc2d3r2-46k2w4qs3r5lgbs6w.hop.clickbank.net/).

The version of the CSV2FXT_renko_mod_b574m1 file for [renko charts](https://www.az-invest.eu/renko-tick-chart-plug-in-for-metatrader4) that is also compatible with bitcoincharts server data is also included in the Dist/MT4/MQL4/Scripts folder.

**Dist** folder contains compiled binaries
**Src** folder contains the source code files (only needed if you intend to modify the code for your needs)
